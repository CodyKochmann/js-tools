This repo holds my often used tools in javascript. Most of the content is not created by myself, but many times is wrapped by my code in order to have a cleaner method for using the main tools in the package.

### Upcoming Changes
- add larger scale compressor for Compressor.js
- add simplified SHA-256 encryption to Crypto
